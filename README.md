# Bookshelf Apps

Bookshelf Apps is a simple web application that allows users to manage their book collections. Users can add new books, mark books as read or unread, move books between shelves, search for books by title, and delete books from their collection.

## Features

- Add new books: Users can add books by entering the title, author, publication year, and reading status (read/unread).
- Manage bookshelves: The app has two shelves, one for books that have been read and another for books that have not been read.
- Move books between shelves: Users can easily move books between the read and unread shelves by toggling their reading status.
- Search for books: Users can search for books by title, filtering the displayed books based on the search query.
- Delete books: Users can delete books from their collection, with a custom confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web pages.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the HTML elements.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing interactive features and logic.
- localStorage: Web storage mechanism used to store the user's book collection locally in the browser.
- Custom Dialog: Implemented for the delete book feature to provide a user-friendly confirmation dialog.
